\subsection{Interaction with Logging and Bookeeping (\LB)}

In this section we describe the interaction of JP with Logging and Bookkeeping
(\LB) service.  The data flows between LB and JP services are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:LB-JP-interactions}.  These flows are numbered and one can use
this numbers to find additional information about each flow in
table~\ref{tab:LB-JP-interactions}.

    1&lb.export.dump,
      lb.export.dump.keep&lb-exporter&
      Export of LB job records into spool directory. It uses glite-lb-purge utility. LB-exporter reads this spool directory in a regular manner and implement next processing of LB dumps. Optionally it can keep handled dumps in lb.export.dump.keep.\\
    \hline
    2&lb.export.jpreg&LB server&When new job come to the LB server 
    it stores its
    registration into the spool directory. It is responsibility of
    JP-importer process to handle such registrations.\\
    \hline
    3&lb.export.jpdump,
      lb.export.jobs,
      lb.export.jobs.keep&lb-exporter&
      LB-exporter do its processing of LB dumps (they are in per job form) and passes on it to the JP-importer using the spool directory lb.export.jpdump and temporary storage lb.export.jobs. It can keep the job files for futher usage.\\
    \hline
    4&none&jp-importer&JP importer handles registrations received from LB
    server and sends it to the JP primary server front-end (using its WS
    interface).\\
    \hline
    5&none&jp-importer&JP importer handles LB dumps received from LB
    exporter and sends it to the JP primary server back-end using its
    gridftp interface.\\

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Only JP Primary Storage (JPPS) server is involved in described
   data flows. JP Index Servers are not part of this picture (they are
   feeded via corresponding JPPS).
 \item Only flows number 4 and 5 are designed to be inter-host. All
   the other interactions assume the components are on the same host and
   do use access to a shared filesystem.
 \item Data flow number 1 use glite-lb-purge utility (see its
   documentation) and passes to it argument from lb.export.purgeargs
   clause of the deployment configuration file. This argument contain
   the timeouts controlling after how long period of time a job
   staying in a terminal state is to be purged from the LB server.
 \item The LB exporter have a feature to store LB job event dumps in a
   directory for further handling (e.g. for job statistic tool). This behaviour
   is controled by lb.export.jobs.keep deployment config file clause (leave
   this clause empty if you don't use dumps for futher handling).
 \item The LB exporter also have a feature to keep all handled LB
   dumps (in glite-lb-purge format) in filesystem. This feature is
   controlled by lb.export.dump.keep.
 \item LB exporter is not a deamon, it's periodic invocation is
   provided by cron deamon.
