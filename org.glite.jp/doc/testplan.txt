1. JPPS standalone

1.1 job registration
1.1.1 basic functionality
- call RegisterJob 
* call GetJobAttributes owner to verify

1.1.2 AuthZ check
* call GetJobAttributes with different credentials - should fail

1.2 tag recording
- call RecordTag
* call GetJobAttributes to verify
- record and retrieve more values of the same tag

1.3 file upload

1.3.1 basic functionality
- call StartUpload, LB dump file type
* check with GetJobFiles -- shoud return nothing
- upload via ftp 
- call CommitUpload
* check with GetJobFiles -- should return URL
- retrieve and check the file

1.3.2 AuthZ checks 
(should fail)
* call GetJobFiles with different credentials

* StartUpload with different credentials

- StartUpload
* ftp upload with different credentials 

* ftp GET with different credentials

1.3.3 cleanup
(not implemented yet)
- call StartUpload, short timeout
- upload via ftp
(don't call CommitUpload)
* uploaded file should be purged after timeout

2. LB plugin 
TODO


3. JPPS-JPIS interaction (feeds)

set of queries (how many?) with different "triggering conditions":
- on job registration
- on LB file upload
- on RecordTag

corresponding sets of jobs to each query, each containing jobs which match
and which don't 

3.1 single batch feed
- upload jobs
- start feed
* check IS contents (jobs and expected attr values)

3.2 single incremental feed
- register feed
- upload jobs one by one
* check IS contents (matching jobs should turn up, others not)

3.3 multiple feeds at time
TODO

3.4 advanced feed features (to be implemented)
- remove
- splitted info about one job (check that the PS doesn't duplicate
  attribute values)


3.x PS-IS AuthZ
TODO, if any


4. IS queries
TBD: insert job sets via JP-IS interaction or directly?

All basic tests:
- clear IS database
- insert prepared job set
- ask queries and check answers
- clear database

TBD: Is one job set enough?

4.1 simple query

4.2 extended query

4.3 check "origin" behaviour (not implemented yet)
- queries with origin tag 

4.4 AuthZ checks
- non owner queries should fail
- to be implemented: ACLs and its evaluation

4.x IS CLI
- standalone tests?
  - prepared config files and command line parameters
  - check expected QueryJobs contents

5. IS standalone (to be implemented)

5.1 server startup

5.1.1 reboot persistency / configuration vs. database content
    situations handling
- prepared config files
- checking behaviour (how?) after reboot with different config file

5.1.2 registration of PS feeds
- prepared config files
- checking appropriate FeedIndex calls

5.2 admin interface
TODO

5.3 type plugin
TODO
