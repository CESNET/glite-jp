Job provenance Index server README
==================================

($Header$)

Job provenance and its components 
---------------------------------

This file contains basic administrator's documentation for Job
provenance (JP) Index server (IS). For Job provenance architecture and
functionality description please see: EGEE architecture document
DJRA1.4 - https://edms.cern.ch/document/594698/ chapter 8.4.
Job provenance interfaces are documented on http://egee.cesnet.cz/en/WSDL/ 
page.

Source code, executables, dependences
-------------------------------------

JP-IS CVS module name is org.glite.jp.index. It depends on common JP libraries
(module org.glite.jp.common, org.glite.jp.server-common) and implements 
interfaces defined in org.glite.jp.ws-interface. It is also based on 
org.glite.lb.server-bones.

JP-IS consist from one stand-alone daemon (glite-jp-indexd) which is
using MySQL database. Default db name is jpis1, all access is granted to
user jpis.

JP-IS interactions:

- JP primary storage - feedins data from primary storage to the IS according
  to particular IS instance administrator needs (expressed by IS configuration)

- IS user query interface - implements IS service for end users

- admin interface - intended for admin tools (management and
  on-the-fly configuration changes)


Release notes 
------------- 

- In this release configuration of JP-IS is rather limited. Parts of
  configuration are hard-coded (src/conf.c)

- Debug outputs are on and directed to /opt/glite/var/log/glite-jp-index.log
  file.

- No admin tools are implemented yet.


Installation
------------

- database setup

  The JP-IS server daemon assume prior creation of its database. Simple tool
  for database creation is org.glite.jp.index/config/dbsetup.sh

- customize startup script /etc/init.d/glite-jp-indexd (see below)
  and set up service startup using this script


Configuration
------------- 

Currently configuration is done by environment variables (see also
startup script template):

GLITE_JPIS_PS   - location of JP-PS server (required parameter)
                  (for example http://umbar.ics.muni.cz:8901)

GLITE_JPIS_PORT - used port (default 8902)

GLITE_JPIS_DB	- database connection string (default jpis/@localhost:jpis1)

GLITE_JPIS_LOGFILE - log file

GLITE_JPIS_PIDFILE - pid file

GLITE_JPIS_DEBUG   - don't daemonize

Other parameters will be configurable in close future. Its
current hard-coded values are in org.glite.jp.index/src/conf.[ch]


Testing 
-------

For testing purposes, simple program is included. It is located in
examples/jpis-test.c and is installed in RPM. It works in three
steps:

1) it simulates response from primary storage, making appropriate
   changes in database. (inserts feedid).

2) it calls updateJobs wsdl call, normally invoked by JP-PS, and
   send some data to JP-IS which stores them im database.

3) it calls queryJobs wsdl call, normally called by user program,
   obtaining previously inserted data.

Test query has form (status=Done OR status=Ready) AND (user!=God).
